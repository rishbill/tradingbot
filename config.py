stock_filter_condition_min_price = True
    # Minimum Stock Price Filter:
        # What It Does: Excludes stocks priced below a certain threshold.
        # Reasoning: Lower-priced stocks often come with higher volatility and risk, and may not meet certain exchange listing requirements, suggesting less stability.

stock_filter_condition_max_stock_price_portfolio_percent = True
    # Maximum Stock Price as Percentage of Portfolio Filter:
        # What It Does: Limits the maximum price of a stock relative to the total portfolio value.
        # Reasoning: Prevents overexposure to any single stock, ensuring diversification and risk management by avoiding too much allocation in high-priced stocks.

    # Minimum P/E Ratio Filter:
        # What It Does: Filters out stocks with a P/E ratio below a certain level.

    # Maximum P/E Ratio Filter:
        # What It Does: Excludes stocks with a P/E ratio above a certain level.

stock_filter_condition_min_revenue_growth_percent = True
    # Minimum Revenue Growth Percentage Filter:

    # Technical Indicators
buy_condition_atr_breakout_level_reached = False
    # ATR Breakout Level:
        # What It Is: Uses the Average True Range (ATR) to determine a volatility-based price level above the current price. The ATR measures market volatility by calculating the average range between high and low prices.
        # What It Tells You: It suggests that the price has moved significantly from its recent range, indicating a potential start of a new trend or continuation of an existing trend with strong momentum.
        # Speed & Sensitivity: The ATR is responsive to market volatility but does not indicate price direction; hence, the breakout level is used as a threshold to gauge significant price moves.
        # How It's Calculated: The breakout level is typically set by adding a multiple of the ATR to the current or recent closing price. A buy signal is generated when the price exceeds this calculated breakout level.

buy_condition_ema_crossover = True
    # EMA (Exponential Moving Average) Crossover:
        # What It Is: This involves two EMAs of different lengths (like short-term and long-term EMAs).
        # What It Tells You: A crossover of these EMAs indicates potential trend changes. For instance, a short-term EMA crossing above a long-term EMA suggests a bullish trend.
        # Speed & Sensitivity: The EMA crossover is sensitive to recent price movements, especially with shorter timeframes, and can provide earlier signals than the MACD.
        # How It's Calculated: By comparing the values of two EMAs (e.g., a 50-day and a 200-day EMA). A crossover event occurs when these two lines intersect, with the short-term EMA moving above or below the long-term EMA.

buy_condition_ema_distance_widening = False
    # EMA Distance Widening:
        # What It Is: This compares the difference between two EMAs (e.g., short and long-term) now and in the past.
        # What It Tells You: Widening distance indicates an increasing difference in trends identified by the two EMAs, potentially signaling a strengthening trend.
        # Speed & Sensitivity: It combines the characteristics of both EMAs, giving a nuanced view of trend momentum.
        # How It's Calculated: By measuring the difference between the short-term and long-term EMAs at two different points in time. If the more recent difference is larger, it suggests the distance is widening.

buy_condition_macd_cross_above_signal = False
    # MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):
        # What It Is: The MACD involves two lines: the MACD line (difference between two EMAs) and the signal line (an EMA of the MACD line).
        # What It Tells You: It shows both trend direction (upward or downward) and momentum (strengthening or weakening). A bullish signal occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line.
        # Speed & Sensitivity: It's a bit slower and smoother compared to some other indicators, providing a broader view of the market trend.
        # How It's Calculated: By subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA (forming the MACD line) and then plotting a 9-period EMA of the MACD line (signal line).

buy_condition_reward_risk_ratio = True
    # Reward-Risk Ratio:
        # What It Is: The ratio compares the potential gain (reward) of a trade to its potential loss (risk).
        # What It Tells You: A higher ratio indicates a more favorable trade, where the potential gain outweighs the potential loss. A common benchmark is a ratio of at least 2:1 (twice as much reward as risk).
        # Speed & Sensitivity: This ratio is a strategic measure, not directly sensitive to rapid market movements, but crucial for evaluating the overall feasibility and soundness of a trade.
        # How It's Calculated:
            # Risk: Calculated as the difference between the current price and the stop-loss price (the lower price at which you'd sell to limit losses). 
            # Reward: Determined by the difference between the current price and the take-profit price (the higher price at which you'd sell to realize gains).

buy_condition_rsi_strong = False
    # Relative Strength Index (RSI):
        # What It Is: RSI measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.
        # What It Tells You: An RSI reading above a certain threshold (like 70) indicates a strong upward price movement (potentially overbought), while below a threshold (like 30) suggests a strong downward movement (potentially oversold).
        # Speed & Sensitivity: It's moderately responsive, providing insights into the overall strength of the current price trend.
        # How It's Calculated: By analyzing the average gains and average losses over a specified period (commonly 14 days) to produce a value between 0 and 100. This value indicates if a stock is potentially overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30).

buy_condition_short_ema_rising = False
    # Short-Term EMA Rising:
        # What It Is: This checks if the current value of a short-term EMA is higher than its previous value.
        # What It Tells You: A rising short-term EMA suggests increasing short-term momentum or an emerging uptrend.
        # Speed & Sensitivity: It's a quick indicator, reacting to recent price changes, making it useful for identifying early trend shifts.
        # How It's Calculated: By comparing the current value of a short-term EMA (e.g., 20-day EMA) with its previous value. If the current value is higher, the short-term EMA is considered to be rising.

buy_condition_stochastic_rsi_strong = False
    # Stochastic RSI:
        # What It Is: This is an indicator of an indicator, measuring the RSI's level relative to its high-low range over a set period.
        # What It Tells You: It identifies overbought or oversold conditions more sensitively than the standard RSI.
        # Speed & Sensitivity: It's highly sensitive and reacts quickly to price movements, making it useful for spotting short-term trend reversals.
        # How It's Calculated: By taking the RSI value and plotting it on a scale of 0 to 100, considering its high and low values over a specific period. It's a measure of the RSI's relative level to its range.
